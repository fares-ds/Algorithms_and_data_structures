# Algorithms_and_data_structures
Data structures and algorithms are vital elements in many computing applications. When programmers design and build applications, they need to model the application data. What this data consists of depends on the purpose and context of the application. However, it is generally a requirement for any application to insert, edit and query a data store. Data structures offer different ways to store data items, while the algorithms provide techniques for managing this data.
## Application Data
Computing applications use many different types of data. Some applications model data within database systems, in which case the database system handles the details of choosing data structures, as well as the algorithms to manage them. However, in many cases, applications model their own data. When programmers decide what type of data structure to use for a particular set of data in an application, they need to take into account the specific data items to be stored, the relationships between data items and how the data will be accessed from within the application logic.
